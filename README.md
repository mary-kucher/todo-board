# TODO Board

This is a web application that allows visitors to manage task boards with a simple and intuitive user interface. Each visitor can create, update, and delete boards and manage tasks within those boards. The tasks are organized into three columns: To Do, In Progress, and Done. Users can enter a board ID to load the relevant board and its columns with cards.
